<h1>Topic 1: Computer Hardware and Software</h1>
<p>A <dfn>computer</dfn> is a system that manipulates data according to a set of instructions. In order for
   a computer to perform useful tasks, it needs the following three things:</p>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Hardware</strong>: The devices and components that make up a computer system are called hardware. Many parts
  are contained within the computer's case. Other parts are connected to the computer and are referred to as peripheral
  devices. Most peripherals allow information to be entered (input) and retrieved (output).</li>
  <li><strong>Software</strong>: The instructions that a computer follows come from software, or in other words, computer
  programs. A basic software environment is established by the computer's operating system (OS). Software applications,
  such as word processors, spreadsheet programs, and payroll programs, can be installed within the OS to extend
  the range of things that the computer can be used to do. Having different software applications means that the same
  hardware can be put to a variety of uses.</li>
  <li><strong>User</strong>: Software provides an interface for the user to control the computer system.
  The user creates data files by inputting information and selecting commands from the interface.</li>
</ol>
