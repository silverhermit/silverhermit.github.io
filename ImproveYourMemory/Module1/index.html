<h1>Module 1: The Mysteries of the Human Brain</h1>
<h2>Part 1: Understanding Our Brains</h2>
<p>The human brain is the central organ of the human nervous system and, with the spinal cord, makes up the central nervous system. It constitutes only about 2% of the human body, yet it is responsible for all the body's functions. It is our brains that help us write, run, sing, sigh, and understand all that we see.</p>
<p>This 1.5 kg of soft tissue controls and coordinates our actions and reactions, it facilitates our thinking and feeling, and it enables us to make decisions and to store and retrieve memories.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>How Does the Brain Work?</h3>
<img src="images/brain.png">
<p>The human brain has three main areas:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cerebrum</li>
<li>Cerebellum</li>
<li>Brain stem.</li>
</ul>
<p>The cerebrum is the largest part of the brain and has right and left hemispheres. This part of your brain controls higher functions such as your senses, language comprehension, speech, reasoning, problem solving, judgement, emotions, learning, and fine control of movement.</p>
<p>Together, the left and right hemispheres are divided into four sections called lobes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Frontal</li>
<li>Parietal</li>
<li>Temporal </li>
<li>Occipital</li>
</ul>
<img src="images/brain2.jpg">
<p>Each of these lobes is believed to control one or more functions. For example, the frontal lobe controls personality, decision-making and reasoning. The temporal lobe, which contains two segments called the hippocampus and the amygdala, controls speech, sense of smell, emotions, and memory.</p>
<p>The cerebellum, known as the "little brain," is located at the back of the brain near the brain stem. The cerebellum receives information from the sensory systems, the spinal cord, and other parts of the brain and is thus responsible for coordinating voluntary movements and functions including motor skills such as balance, coordination, and posture.</p>
<p>Finally, the brain stem is positioned in the posterior part of the brain, continuous with the spinal cord. It controls the flow of messages between the brain and the rest of the body, and is also in charge of many basic functions such as breathing, swallowing, heart rate, blood pressure, consciousness, and whether one is awake or sleepy.</p>
<h3>How We Think</h3>
<p>The basic cells of the brain are called neurons. We start life with about 100 billion neurons, which may seem like quite a lot until you consider that we then proceed to lose around 100,000 each day for the rest of our lives. If you want to know the maths, that is close to 37 million per year and around 3 billion over a lifetime!</p>
<p>Neurons constantly communicate with one another, creating little gaps called synapses that allow them to pass electrical or chemical signals to another neuron. They are the basic working unit of the brain and are responsible for receiving sensory input from the external world, for sending commands to our nerve cells, glands, and muscles, among other actions.</p>
<p>Scientists generally agree that neurons "learn" by recognising various patterns of connection among its synapses and fire when they see this pattern. The more patterns that are seen, the more chemicals and electricity are fired, and the more connections, or "learning," are developed. These are our thoughts and memories, built up and made easier through patterns. Through the accumulation of activated and reactivated perception that such patterns encourage, we are thus able to learn and repeat experiences.</p>
<p>Let's now move specifically onto the making of memories themselves.</p>
<h2>Part 2: Different Types of Memory - Sensory Memory</h2>
<p>In general, we all know what memory is. If we were to define it, we might say it <strong>is the ability to retain and recall personal experiences, details, skills and habits</strong>. Yet, while we can explain it easily enough, understanding how we make memories is much more difficult. For starters, it is both a psychological and biological process. Secondly, scientists have not yet established an accepted, validated model for the actual mechanics of memory. However, they do agree upon the forms that memory takes and where each type of memory is actuated.</p>
<p>While memory is created and stored throughout the brain, science has shown us that some regions are associated with specific types of memory. The temporal lobe is important for sensory memory, for example, while the frontal lobe is associated with both short- and long-term memory.</p>
<h3>Sensory Memory</h3>
<p>Sensory memory is the first and shortest form of memory and takes in information through your five senses. As we noted above, the temporal and occipital lobes are involved in this memory form. The reason for this is that these sections of the brain are associated with sensation.</p>
<p>Sensory memory has no storage capability; it is a temporary "holding cell" for sensory information, capable of holding information for approximately 200-500 milliseconds before either passing it to short-term memory or letting it disappear.</p>
<p>Its purpose is to allow your brain time to process and create order out of whatever sensations you're experiencing. Think of it as the start of a memory, such as when you step out of a plane on the first day of your summer holiday and immediately take in the sounds, smell, or sense of heat on your skin.</p>
<p>There are three types of sensory memory:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sensory memory triggered by <strong>visual</strong> <strong>stimuli</strong> is known as <strong>iconic</strong> memory.</li>
<li>Sensory memory triggered by <strong>touch</strong> is known as the <strong>haptic</strong> memory.</li>
<li>Sensory memory triggered by <strong>aural</strong> <strong>stimulus</strong> is known as <strong>echoic</strong> memory.</li>
</ul>
<p>Interestingly, memories related to smell persist and last longer in humans and rarely need to be reinforced to be remembered. The reason for this is that the amygdala (which is situated in the temporal lobe) and the olfactory cortex (where small perceptions are stored) are physically very close, separated only by a few synapses (i.e. the place where nerve cells connect with other nerve cells).</p>
<p>This is the reason why the scent of a certain perfume suddenly reminds you of your mother or the smell of freshly mown grass conjures up images of a summer in childhood.</p>
<h2>Part 3: Short-Term Memory, Long-Term Memory and Retrospective and Prospective Memories</h2>
<h3>Short-Term Memory</h3>
<p>Short-term memory is also called <strong>primary</strong> or <strong>active</strong> memory. Recent events and sensory data such as sounds are stored here, but typically for less than a minute.</p>
<p>It primarily takes place in the frontal lobe; though from there, it touches down in the hippocampus. The hippocampus is like a sorting area for the consolidation of information from short-term to long-term memory.</p>
<p>As well as not being able to retain information for a long period, the amount of information you can retain in your short-term memory is equally limited. It is believed to be capable of storing only five to nine items at a time and new information can also bump out other items.</p>
<p>An excellent example of short-term memory is remembering the beginning of a paragraph while reading the rest so that information can be processed, and a logical connection can be formed between all the words.</p>
<p>It's worth making a note here that the term "short-term memory" is often used interchangeably with "working memory." However, there are differences between the two. Although both are intertwined and neither holds information for a long time, short-term memory simply stores information while working memory stores and uses it. A good example of working memory is listening to a teacher speak while taking notes in our own words.</p>
<h3>Long-Term Memory</h3>
<p>Long-term memory holds information for much longer periods than sensory and short-term memory and is, therefore, the final, semi-permanent stage of memory. The processes of consolidating and storing long-term memories have been particularly associated with the prefrontal cortex, cerebrum, frontal lobe, and medial temporal lobe.</p>
<p>However, what's fascinating is that after consolidation, long-term memories appear to be stored throughout the brain.</p>
<p>Long-term memory can generally be broken down into two categories: explicit and implicit memory.</p>
<h4>Explicit Memory</h4>
<p>Explicit memory, also known as conscious or declarative memory, is a type of memory that needs a conscious effort to be recalled. It is defined as the memory recall of facts and figures and is also known as the "knowing what" memory. Information and data is stored explicitly and needs to be recalled overtly.</p>
<p>Explicit memory is further sub-classified into episodic and semantic memories.</p>
<p><strong>Episodic memory</strong> stores our recollection of certain events and experiences in our lives and allows us to recall details connected with that event. Our emotions play a vital role in remembering and recording some events in our long-term memories. Some examples of episodic memory are:</p>
<ul>
<li>The first day of a new job</li>
<li>The first time a holiday to Thailand was taken with friends</li>
<li>Where you were and how you felt during an earthquake.</li>
</ul>
<p>Unlike episodic memory, which is linked to personal emotions and experiences, <strong>semantic memory</strong> is the recall of general and common facts and information, such as the phonics of letters, the states in America or the sounds of different keys in a guitar. Simply stated, it is associated with the recollection of general knowledge.</p>
<h4>Implicit Memory</h4>
<p>Implicit memory, also called procedural memory, is memory that involves procedures for completing actions. These actions develop with practice over time and do not require a conscious effort to be recalled. An example might be how to tie a shoelace, walk or swim, play an instrument, or perform a dance step in exercise.</p>
<p>Implicit memory allows us to remember skills and movements that are embedded in our brains so deeply that we might not even be aware of remembering them. It allows us to perform activities that, once learnt completely, do not have to be learned again.</p>
<p>Children under the age of seven rely more on procedural memory to remember things. Adults have been noted to use declarative memory to learn and process new information.</p>
<h3>Retrospective and Prospective Memories</h3>
<p>There are two further types of memories that can be either explicit or implicit. These are retrospective and prospective memories.</p>
<p><strong>Retrospective memory</strong> is the recollection of words, phrases, events and experiences that happened in a person's past. It is usually the amalgamation of semantic, explicit and implicit, autobiographical and episodic memories.</p>
<p><strong>Prospective memories</strong> are linked with the future and are activated when remembering something to be done in the future. It is triggered by cues, such as remembering to call a friend by seeing the telephone.</p>
<p>It has been observed that at certain times, retrospective and prospective memories are linked and do not function as separate entities. In some cases, where retrospective memory has been impaired or damaged, it has a significant impact on prospective memories as well. But similarly, it has also been observed in some cases that impaired prospective memory has no impact on retrospective memory, clearly distinguishing the two apart.</p>
<h2>Part 4: Encoding, Storage and Retrieval</h2>
<p>There are three crucial steps to making memories: encoding, storage and retrieval.</p>
<h3>Memory Encoding</h3>
<p>Memory encoding is the first crucial step. Through sensory memory, the brain obtains information from the environment. It typically does this through visual, auditory and physically felt cues, known respectively as iconic, echoic, and haptic memory.</p>
<p>If you give your attention to the sensory information you're receiving, neurons start to fire in your frontal lobe and thalamus (a mostly grey matter structure that has roles involving relaying motor and sensory signals, as well as regulation of consciousness and alertness). In simple terms, what you're now doing is opening the gates to the memory-making process.</p>
<p>Interestingly, emotion tends to increase attention, and the emotional element of an experience is processed on an unconscious pathway in the brain leading to the <strong>amygdala</strong>, the area of our brain involved with the experiencing of emotions.</p>
<p>Think for a minute of falling in love. People who have experienced this often say they knew the person was for them the moment their eyes met or when their hands touched accidently, and they felt sparks fly!</p>
<p>So, once something or someone has caught your attention and you've felt sensations (albeit all in the space of a second or less), the likelihood is that the event will be encoded.</p>
<p>It is generally agreed that there are three primary types of encoding:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Acoustic Encoding</strong> - Acoustic encoding is the use of hearing, or auditory stimuli, to encourage memories.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Visual Encoding</strong> - Visual encoding is the process of encoding images and visual sensory information. For example, the creation of mental pictures is a way in which individuals use visual encoding.</li>
<li><strong>Semantic Encoding</strong> - Semantic encoding is not so much derived from the senses but is the process of encoding sensory input that has particular meaning or can be applied to a particular context. Again, this is when feelings or emotions are associated with an event or person.</li>
</ul>
<p>Many experts agree that encoding for short-term memory storage relies mainly on acoustic encoding, while encoding for long-term storage generally depends more on semantic encoding.</p>
<p>Either way, as encoding occurs, the separate sensations or perceptions travel to the hippocampus where they are consolidated into one single experience.</p>
<h3>Storage</h3>
<p>As we noted earlier, the hippocampus acts as a sorting area for the consolidation of information from short-term to long-term memory. Experts believe that this process is also aided by the frontal cortex. Together, the hippocampus and frontal cortex evaluate which of the various sensations that have come through the sensory register to be encoded are worth remembering.</p>
<p>The information that the hippocampus and frontal cortex deems worthy of retaining is then transferred into long-term memory. The rest remains in the short-term memory for a duration of 15-30 seconds, after which, without any form of a memory rehearsal or other activity to prolong the information, it spontaneously decays.</p>
<p>In the 1950s, George Miller of Harvard University's Department of Psychology suggested that the short-term memory could store up to nine items. Known as Miller's Law, this is often cited as the magical number seven, plus or minus two. However, more recent studies have suggested that the number of items stored in our short-term memory is more likely to be four pieces of information, plus or minus one.</p>
<p>The storage capacity of long-term memory, on the other hand, appears to be boundless, with memories often lasting a lifetime.</p>
<p>The exact mechanics of how information is sorted and transferred to long-term memory are not fully understood. However, it appears that the process begins with the creation of a memory trace.</p>
<h4>Memory Traces</h4>
<p>A memory trace, also known as an engram, is the cognitive interpretation of these sensations, theorised to be the means by which memories are stored. We say theorised because memory traces are units of cognition and, therefore, we can't see them. Additionally, whether these memories are stored by way of a chemical process (biochemical) or a biological process (biophysical) is also up for debate.</p>
<p>However, what is generally agreed upon is that memory traces are spread over several areas of the brain rather than being grouped in one central space. It appears that after consolidation, neurons that instigated a particular element of a memory, such as a sight or emotion, are grouped together and stored in the brain area that initiated that component. Some studies have also indicated that these memory traces are encoded several times.</p>
<p>If this is true (and there are ongoing studies around this theory), it means that if one memory trace is destroyed, duplicate replicas can be retrieved and a memory can be reconstructed. The implication here is that long-term memories are not set in stone, locked away like pages in a diary. Rather, they are continuously processed, possibly added to and maybe even changed or reclassified according to other information that is being processed in our brains.</p>
<h3>Retrieval</h3>
<p>After encoding and storage comes retrieval. This is the process by which a memory stored on an unconscious level is recovered or recalled and brought into your conscious mind.</p>
<p>The retrieval of information from the short-term memory is very different to that of the long-term memory. Short term memory is stored in a sequence. For example, if a group of people are given a list of items to memorise and are then asked to name the fifth item on the list, they will typically go through the whole list in the order given to retrieve the fifth word.</p>
<p>Long-term memory is retrieved through recognition or recall. In recognition, the presentation of a familiar outside stimulus provides a cue for the information to be retrieved. Think of those times when we go upstairs to get something only to arrive on the landing and forget what we're there for! By returning to the room where the decision to go upstairs was made, we're more likely to remember what item we had to get.</p>
<p>In recall, the information must be retrieved from memories. Memory retrieval can occur in several different ways, and there are several variables that can affect it, including how long it has been since the last time you retrieved the memory, what other information you have learned in the meantime, etc.</p>
<p>There are three main types of recall in the mental process of retrieving information: serial recall, free recall, and cued recall.</p>
<h4>Serial Recall</h4>
<p>Serial recall is the ability to recall items or events in a particular order, usually the order in which they occurred.</p>
<h4>Free Recall</h4>
<p>Free recall tasks are different altogether. Instead of remembering things in chronological order, free recall deals with memorising and recalling any or all pieces of information from a given time.</p>
<p>For example, one of the most common experiments or illustrations of this is shown by giving individuals a list with multiples items. They are then asked to memorise the items printed on the list and recall whatever they can.</p>
<h4>Cued Recall</h4>
<p>Cued recall is the retrieval of memory with the help of cues. Cued recall differs from free recall in that the cue presented that is related to the information being remembered (rather than being the information). This then kickstarts in the process of memory retrieval.</p>
