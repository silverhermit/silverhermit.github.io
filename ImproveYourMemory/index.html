<h1>Improve Your Memory Course Introduction</h1>
  <h3><a href="module-list">Jump to Course Modules List</a></h3>
<p>The human memory is a mystery box. The more one tries to understand it, the more secrets one unlocks. And yet, what is equally fascinating is that this mystery box helps us to define and shape who we are. Our memories of childhood, friendship, first love, betrayals and bonds build up as our internal biographies. These are the stories that we tell ourselves about what we know and who we are. Thus, memories are vital to our unique understanding (or interpretation) of ourselves but also as a cornerstone of what it means to be human.</p>
<p>But memory, like so much in the human body, can weaken and fade. Certainly, as we grow older, we lose a lot of personal memories, but we can also start to lose our ability to retain and recall memories. We might call it forgetfulness, but it is actually a weakening of our memory muscles.</p>
<p>Luckily, like other muscles in our bodies, we can strengthen those which involve memory. Mental exercises can keep our memories sharp and strong, and various techniques can be used to enhance our ability to remember more at a quicker and more capable pace.</p>
<h1 id="#module-list">Course Modules</h1>
<p><a href="Module1/index.html">Module 1</a> looks at the many mysteries of the human brain. The module introduces the basics of how a memory is formed and what factors go into the formation of a memory. It also looks at the areas of forgetfulness and false memories.</p>
<p><strong>Module 2</strong> looks at various memory principles and highlights three specific areas that underpin much of those principles, as well as the important technique of repetition. It also explores physical fitness, sleep and meditation as three additional means of enhancing your memory.</p>
<p><strong>Module 3</strong> then moves onto discuss mnemonic memory techniques that are popularly used to improve your memory.</p>
<p><strong>Modules 4</strong> introduces you to the peg system. This is slightly more complicated than the techniques of the previous module but are important in the area of memory improvement.</p>
<p><strong>Module 5</strong> offers situational techniques for remembering names, places, presentations, formulas, important dates, daily tasks, scripts, speeches and words from foreign languages.</p>
